In this position, I work on securely implementing innovative authentication technologies, primarily the Go-based backend services as well as our iOS apps and components. As we&amp;rsquo;re a small startup, I am also responsible for driving CI/CD efforts and helping ensure that our self-hosted infrastructure purrs along happily.
I previously obtained my Ph.D. in applied cryptography and systems security at the same research group, supervised by Ingrid Verbauwhede.</description></item></channel></rss>
