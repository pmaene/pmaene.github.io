Senior R&D Engineer at [nextAuth](https://nextauth.com), a spin-off coming from the [COSIC](https://cosic.esat.kuleuven.be) research group at KU Leuven. In this position, I work on securely implementing innovative authentication technologies, primarily the Go-based backend services as well as our iOS apps and components. As we're a small startup, I am also responsible for driving CI/CD efforts and helping ensure that our self-hosted infrastructure purrs along happily.

I previously obtained my Ph.D. in applied cryptography and systems security at the same research group, supervised by Ingrid Verbauwhede. My dissertation work focused on trusted computing architectures and hardware-software co-design, designing and building strong protection mechanisms rooted in hardware.

In my free time, I love to go out for an occasional walk, but particularly love multi-day mountain hikes üèî. I do have to admit that you're also likely to find me in front of the TV watching a good movie or the latest show. Some friends and I also run [Student IT](https://studentit.be), a nonprofit which offers IT services to student organisations. Finally, I like tinkering with computers outside of work too (though it's not always appreciated when I accidentally break our Internet üòâ).
